# Homework_2
Homework 2 was a bit more difficult then I thought it would be. I originally
thought that I would be able to breeze through this, then I realized that I
truly knew nothing about this language and I was a bit stuck. I read through the
textbook a few times then I did the live work on code academy, and finally
resorted to going to Udemy to get some help with this. I never expected
JavaScript to be so much like a playscript. I think the roughest part I had with
this assignment would have to be the JavaScript itself. Cant wait til next week.
